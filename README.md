# Getting Started with Create React App
# js-cv-application
First "big" REACT project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

DESIGN:

1. Create a new project using npx create-react-app cv-project. If you need a reminder on how it works, check out the previous lessons. Don’t forget to setup a GitHub repository for your project, to push your progress.

2. Remove the boilerplate code created by create-react-app.

3. You should use class components for this project. You’re going to find a lot of code written using class components and this practical experience will help you understand it when encountered. You’ll also revisit this project in a later lesson to replace the class components with functional ones.

4. Think about how to structure your application into components. Your application should include:
    a. A section to add general information like name, email, phone number.
    b. A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)
    c. A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main tasks of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

5. Be sure to include an edit and submit button for each section or for the whole CV, your preference. The submit button should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements. The edit button should add back (display) the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. In those input fields, you should be able to edit and resubmit the content. You’re going to make heavy use of state and props, so make sure you understood those concepts.

6. Create a components folder in your src directory and add your components.

7. Include a styles folder in your src directory for your CSS files. You’ll need to import these in the component files to use them.

8. Don’t forget to push your solution to GitHub. You should be proud of your work and show it off to the world!
